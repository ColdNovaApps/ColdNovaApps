      <h2>Terms of Service</h2>

      <p>
        These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Fake Chat mobile
        application ("App"), developed and operated by Coldnova ("we", "our",
        or "us"). By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be
        bound by these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Use of the App</h2>
      <p>
        Fake Chat allows users to generate custom notifications that visually
        resemble standard messaging notifications for entertainment, design,
        educational, and demonstration purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree to use the App responsibly, lawfully, and in accordance with
        all applicable local, state, national, and international laws.
      </p>

      <h2>Prohibited Uses</h2>
      <p>
        You agree not to use Fake Chat for:
      </p>
      <p>
        • Impersonation or identity theft<br />
        • Harassment, threats, or intimidation<br />
        • Fraud, deception, or scams<br />
        • Creating misleading evidence or false records<br />
        • Any illegal, harmful, or abusive activities
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not responsible for any misuse of the App. You assume full
        responsibility for all actions taken using Fake Chat.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        Fake Chat does not interact with real messaging apps, does not read real
        messages, and does not access SMS, iMessage, or any third-party chat
        platforms. All content generated within the App is entirely fictional
        and user-created.
      </p>

      <h2>Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
      <p>
        Fake Chat offers optional subscription-based features. Payments are
        processed securely by Apple via the App Store. Subscription management,
        billing, cancellations, and refunds are handled exclusively through your
        Apple ID account settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not control or store payment information.
      </p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All rights, title, and interest in and to the App, including its design,
        branding, features, and code, are owned by Coldnova. You may not copy,
        modify, distribute, sell, or reverse engineer any part of the App.
      </p>

      <h2>User Content</h2>
      <p>
        You retain full ownership of any text you enter into the App. Since all
        content remains on-device, we do not access, store, or claim ownership
        of any user-generated content.
      </p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the App at any
        time if you violate these Terms or misuse the App.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, Coldnova shall not be liable for
        any indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out
        of or related to your use or inability to use the App.
      </p>

      <h2>No Warranty</h2>
      <p>
        The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any
        kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of
        merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. Any changes will be posted
        on this page. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept
        the revised Terms.
      </p>
